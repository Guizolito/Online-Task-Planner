# The Organizer 2.0
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/jkCDg_td-eA
#### Description:
The project I developed consists of a completely online agenda for day-to-day usage. 

Anyone with projects, goals or ambitions has plans in mind for the future.

By having your own personalized page, you'll be able to keep
reminders and future events all up-to-date, consulting them whenever and wherever, just by
accessing the page.

The project allows you to keep your plans in order, providing easy
access whenever you feel lost. No more physical agendas made out of paper, keep it on-line.

The file is divided into 3 parts: static, templates & the applications.

The static folder contains the css file, where all the aesthetics was dealt with, for the whole project. It also includes all the images used on the project, all of them
either obtained from free images websites or taken by me.

The templates contains all the html panels used on the website.
Index.html is the home page, where you get introduced to the website, have access to all the other pages and also check a little easter egg, sending you to a video of how its
background image was taken.
About.html is essentially the common "about" page, containing information about the website, myself and also my social media.
Login.html is where you login onto your account.
Register.html is where you register a new account, located on the "login.html" page.
Main.html is where all the magic happens. You get to access your reminders and future events, delete them and add even more! The very minimalistic design allows it to focus
on what is actually important on the page.
Reminder.html is where you create your own reminder. You simply add the description, save it and boom, you're redirected to the main page and it will be there for you to never
forget.
Agenda.html is where you create your own future event. It essentially works just like the Reminder page, adding the possibility of including the date for said event.
Apology.html is where you get redirected to when something goes wrong! A little meme should appear, alongside the occurring error.

Onto the last part of the project: the applications.

Application.py is all the wiring at the back of your desk, connecting this to that and allowing your pc to run, your printer to print and somehow turn on your study lamp. It contains
all the coding involving python and allowing the dynamic feel to the website, with all the logins, the logouts, adding or removing stuff.
Helpers.py is the previous' application little helper, keeping all the crazy algorithms that provide a less heavy sight to the Apology page.
Last, but definitely not least, we have the project.db. It is where all the data is kept, including logins, reminders, and also agendas. It is the cement of the brick wall that is
this project.

The website itself it very intuitive, allowing a simple, yet efficient experience and, most importantly, it gets the job done.

Thank you so much for the opportunity, thank you to David and Brian and the whole CS50 community.
